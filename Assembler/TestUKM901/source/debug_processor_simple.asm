# Program debug_processor_simple.asm
# This program performs some simple tests of the processor reading from and
# writing to the data bus.
#
# Required instructions:
# load, store, and, bz, jump
#
# Note: SW0 is the reset switch.
#
# Expected functionality (# == LED on, . == LED off, + == LED blinking):
# After reset, LEDs 0 to 7 are turned on:
#   ########
#
# Pushing the rotary encoder knob lets LED0 and LED7 blink with 1Hz and turns
# LEDs 1,2,5 and 6 off again:
#   ########
# <push>
#   ++++++++
#
# Pushing or turning the knob again turns all LEDs off again.
#   ++++++++
# <push>
#   ........
# <push>
#   ++++++++
# <push>
#   ........
#
# Hints for debugging:
# - All LEDs stay off:
#		Did the configuration download work? Then check the led connections from
#		the debug_module to the toplevel.
# - LEDs show pattern "10101010":
#		Check reset polarity, the clock signal, IO- and bus-connections. The
#		first two instructions (load+store) might also be the cause of the
#		problem.
# - All LEDs stay on:
#   	The load/store instructions seems to work, but one of the others
#		doesn't. Try to figure out which instruction fails by using some
#		additional stores for writing different values to the LEDs.
#
# You can extend this program to test your peripherials and other instructions,
# once it works as expected.
